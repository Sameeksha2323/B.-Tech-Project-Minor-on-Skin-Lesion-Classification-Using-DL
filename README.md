# Skin Lesion Classification Using Transfer Learning-Refined CNN Architectures

**Department of Applied Mathematics** **Delhi Technological University**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation code for our **B. Tech Project (Minor)**. The objective of this project is to classify skin lesions into seven distinct diagnostic categories (including Melanoma) using various Deep Learning architectures.

The project explores the performance of a custom baseline CNN against widely used transfer learning models, employing techniques such as **Feature Extraction** and **Fine-Tuning** to optimize performance on the HAM10000 dataset.
